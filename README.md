This repo has example code from MLflows course. 

# Challenge Exercises

    ## 1. Try using MLflow Tracking to log metrics and parameters from a machine learning experiment.

    ## 2. Package up a simple machine learning model as an MLflow Project. 

    ## 3. Use the MLflow UI to compare multiple runs of an experiment

    ## 4. Try deploying a machine learning model using the MLflow Model Registry and MLflow Deployments for LLMs. Observe how model governance and access control can be implemented.

    ## 5. Explore using MLflow with a specific machine learning library like PyTorch or TensorFlow. See how logging model artifacts as MLflow models allows framework-agnostic deployment.
